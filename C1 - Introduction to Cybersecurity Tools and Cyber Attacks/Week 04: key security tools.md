Q1. What is the primary function of a firewall?

Filter traffic between networks.

Q2. How many unique encryption keys are required for 2 people to exchange a series of messages using symmetric key cryptography?

1

Q3. What are the three (3) types of modern encryption?

Symmetric
Asymmetric      
Hash

Q4. What is Locard’s exchange principle?

The perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as forensic evidence.

Q5. Which two (2) are types of firewall ?

Packet-filtering
Application-level

Q6. Which type of data does a packet-filtering firewall inspect when it decides whether to forward or drop a packet ?

All of the above.

Q7. Which three (3) of the following are limitations of Application gateways?

Ezoic
Client software must be “smart” and know to contact the gateway.
Each application to be managed needs its own gateway.
Application gateways are susceptible to IP spoofing.

Q8. Which type of firewall inspects XML packet payloads for things like executable code, a target IP address that make sense, and a known source IP address ?

An XML Gateway.

Q9. Which statement about Stateful firewalls is True ?

They have state tables that allow them to compare current packets with previous packets.

Q10. True or False: Most Antivirus/Antimalware software works by comparing a hash of every file encountered on your system against a table of hashs of known viruses and malware previously made by the antivirus/antimalware vendor.

True

Q11. Which type of cryptographic attack is characterized by comparing a captured hashed password against a table of many millions of previously hashed words or strings?


Ezoic
Rainbow tables

Q12. What are two (2) drawbacks to using symmetric key encryption?

The sender and recipient must find a secure way to share the key itself.
You need to use a different encryption key with everyone you communicate with, otherwise anyone who has ever received an encrypted message from you could open any message you sent to anyone else using that key.
