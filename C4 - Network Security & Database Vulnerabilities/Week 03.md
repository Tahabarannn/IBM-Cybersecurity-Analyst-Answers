A Data Protection Solution Example, IBM Security Guardium Use Cases ( Practice Quiz )
Q1. In setting up policy rules for data monitoring, what is the purpose of “exclude” rules?

To exclude certain applications or safe activities from being logged.
Q2. True or False: Data monitoring products such as IBM Guardium can send access alerts to Syslog for manual intervention by a security analyst but must be connected to additional applications if automated interventions are desired.

False

When the activity took place.
What activity took place.
Q6. True of False: In the IBM Guardium data monitoring tool, the number of failed login attempts that would trigger an alert are always counted since the last successful login.

False
Q7. Which activity should be considered suspicious and might indicate inappropriate activity is being attempted?

Attempts are made to access data using nonstandard tools, such as MS Excel or MS Access, rather than through the application the data belongs to.
