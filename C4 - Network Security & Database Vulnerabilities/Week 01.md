Introduction to the TCP/IP Protocol Framework 
Q1. Which four (4) factors does a stateless firewall look at to determine if a packet should be allowed to pass?

the source IP address
the destination port
the destination IP address
the service or protocol used
Q2. Can a single firewall conduct both a stateless and stateful inspection?

Yes, the stateless inspection is conducted first and then a stateful inspection is done.

Q3. True or False: An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is generally a passive device that listens to network traffic and alerts an administrator when a potential problem is detected?

Ezoic
False

Q4. Network Address Translation (NAT) typically conducts which of the following translations?

A private network IP address to a public network IP address and vice versa.
Q5. Which type of NAT routing allows one-to-one mapping between local and global addresses?

Static

Network Protocols over Ethernet and Local Area Networks

Q1. Which network layer do IP addresses belong to?

The Network Layer

Q2. Which address assures a packet is delivered to a computer on a different network segment from the sender?

Ezoic
The IP Address

Q3. A network device that is capable of sending and receiving data at the same time is referred to as which of the following?

Full duplex

Q4. True or False: Collision avoidance protocols are critical to the smooth operation of modern networks.

False
Q5. Comparing bridges with switches, which are three (3) characteristics specific to a bridge?

Virtual LANs are not possible.
End-user devices share bandwidth on each port.
Half-duplex transmission.
Q6. True or False: Switches solved the problem of network loops and improved the performance of multicast/broadcast traffic.

Ezoic
False
Basics of Routing and Switching, Network Packets and Structures
Q1. If a network server has four (4) network interface cards, how many MAC addresses will be associated with that server?

4
Q2. True or False: When you connect your laptop to a new network, a new IP address will be assigned.

True
Q3. What does the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) do when it needs to send a message to a location that is outside its broadcast domain?

ARP sends the message to the MAC address of the default gateway.
Ezoic
Q4. Routing tables are maintained by which of the following devices?

On any network connected device.
Q5. What is the purpose of a default gateway?

It forwards messages coming from, or going to, external networks.
Q6. If a message is being sent to a computer that is identified in the computer’s routing table, what type of connection would be established?

Direct

Quiz 02
TCP/IP Framework ( Main Quiz )
Q1. What is meant by “stateless” packet inspection?

It is a packet-by-packet inspection with no awareness of previous packets.
Q2. True or False: An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is generally a passive device that listens to network traffic and alerts an administrator when a potential problem is detected?

Ezoic
True
Q3. True or False: The primary difference between an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is that an IDS is designed as a passive system that listens and alerts while an IPS is an active system that is designed to take action when a problem is detected?

True
Q4. Which intrusion system does not add any delay to network traffic?

Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
Q5. How does using Network Address Translation (NAT) provide an additional layer of security to your network?

By hiding the real IP addresses of all the devices on your private network and exposing only a single public IP address.
Q6. Which type of NAT routing maps unregistered IP addresses to a single registered IP address allowing thousands of users to be connected to the Internet using only a single global IP address?

Ezoic
Overload
Q7. Which network layer do MAC addresses belong to?

The Data Link Layer.
Q8. Which address assures a packet is delivered to a computer on the same network segment as the sender?

The MAC address.
Q9. A network device that cannot send and receive data at the same time is referred to as which of the following?

Half duplex
Q10. When a NIC reads a packet header and sees the destination address is not its own address, what does it do with the packet?

It discards the packet.
Q11. Comparing bridges with switches, which are three (3) characteristics specific to a switch?

Virtual LANs are possible.
Full-duplex transmission.
Each port is dedicated to a single device; bandwidth is not shared.
Ezoic
Q12. True or False: Switches can connect two geographically dispersed networks.

False
Q13. A network interface card’s MAC address is also known by which two (2) of the following? (Select 2)

The physical address.
The burn address.
Q14. What is the main function of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)?

To translate a MAC address to an IP address and vice versa.
Q15. What does a router do when it needs to send a packet to an address that is not in its routing table?

Ezoic
It forwards the packet to the default gateway.
Q16. What happens to messages sent from a computer that has no gateway address specified?

Messages sent to other computers on the same subnet will be delivered but those destined to computers on other networks will not be delivered.
Q17. Which three (3) are types of routes found in a routing table?

Default
Direct
Dynamic
